Description
----------------

GoFish lets you double-right-click anywhere on the game world to fish,
and enhances sound effects while fishing.

Fishing mode can be toggled using a keybind or slash command, and is
automatically enabled while a fishing pole is equipped, or when mousing
over a fishing pool. Fishing mode is disabled if you enter combat or
unequip a fishing pole, or after 10 seconds of no fishing activity if
it was enabled via mouseover.

GoFish does not support lures or other skill-enhancing items, as these
are not neccessary or especially useful in Mists of Pandaria.


Usage
---------

Type "/gofish" or bind a key to toggle fishing mode manually. Options
to adjust fishing sound levels will be added in the near future. Other
options or additional features are not planned.


Localization
-----------------

Compatible with English, Deutsch, Español, Français, Italiano, Português,
Русский, 한국어, 简体中文, and 繁體中文 game clients.

Credits
-----------

GoFish was inspired by Ammo's FishermansFriend. The click-casting code
borrows heavily from Torhal's Archy. Fish school name translations were
copied from Kagaro's GatherMate2.
